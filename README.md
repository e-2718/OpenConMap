OpenConMap Toolbox
Ôªø
This toolbox solves the conformal mapping function ùúî (ùúâ) that maps the interior of the unit circle (Canonical domain) on the ùúâ-plane to the exterior of an irregular simple closed curve (Physical domain) on the z-plane. The toolbox is particularly suitable for situations where boundaries contain curves.

The OpenConMap Toolbox is written in MATLAB language. It is released under the MIT License, and its technical documentation and examples are available on GitHub: https://github.com/e-2718/OpenConMap. The toolbox only requires basic Matlab configurations and does not necessitate any installation. Simply adding the folder containing subdirectories to the Matlab path is sufficient. Although we developed this toolbox based on Matlab R2023a, it should be compatible with some earlier Matlab versions, though we don't guarantee this.

The operation of this toolbox requires the installation of Schwarz Christoff Toolbox at the same time, which are available in https://github.com/tobydriscoll/sc-toolbox.
